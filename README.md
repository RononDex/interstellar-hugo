A [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme specifically designed for photography, astronomy and blogging.

This theme is based on the excellent [Persian Hugo Theme](https://github.com/gethugothemes/persian-hugo).

The theme highly focusses on privacy. By default, 0 data from visitors is being captured and all fonts / assets are locally
available (no google cdn or similar is used). It has built in optional support for Google Analytics though.

## Custom Shortcodes
### Zoomable Image
This theme contains a zoomable image viewer, which loads in tiles from an image based on zoom level. This allows for a
performant zoom of high resolution images in a user friendly way (also supports mobile / touch).

It can be used like this:
```markdown
{{< zoomableimage folderPath="/images/post/ngc6188/">}}
```

The folder given in `folderPath` should lead to a folder on the web, with following contents:
 - `thumb.webp`: A thumbnail (lower resolution, smaller download) to preview the high resolution image (usually 1920x1080
or similar is more than enough).
 - `tiled_photo.dzi`: A deep zoom specification file (can be generated using [vips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips))
 - `tiled_photo_files/`: Folder containing the tiles of the different zoom levels (can be generated using [vips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips))
 - `annotations.svg`: Optional file, containing the overlay for annotations over the photo

A bash script to generate all these files can be found here (only works on linux or WSL (untested)):
